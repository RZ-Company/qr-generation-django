# qr-generation-django
Django code for generation of QR Codes.

qr-app-simple (QR Code Generator with Direct URL Input):
This streamlined version accepts URLs directly via the endpoint path and generates QR codes without the need for user interaction through a form. It's useful for automating QR code generation in systems where URLs are predefined or generated by other software components.

qr-app-updated (QR Code Generator with Form Input):
This application version allows users to input URLs through a web form. Upon submission, the server generates a QR code based on the provided URL, displaying it directly in the browser. It's ideal for interactive scenarios where end-users manually input the data they want to encode into QR codes.
